# WebSpeechAPITextToSpeech

For this final project the decision to look at the design and creating of a text-to-speech application came from the interest to understand how education could be made easier for people with visual or learning impairments. The project began with the idea of designing a platform that would be accessible to all types of users, visually appealing and easy to use as well as embarking on having a functional app that would carry out some of the basic needs a user may require from a text-to-speech application. The primary aim of this research project is to develop a more accessible interface that helps users with any impairments, allowing them to interact more freely with articles, websites, and any other online reading materials, to translate this material from text to speech.
